<h2>useR! 2015 Code of Conduct</h2>

<p>All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at useR! 2015 are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout the event. We are expecting cooperation from all participants to help ensuring a safe environment for everybody.</p>

<h3>The Quick Version</h3>

<p>useR! 2015 is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of useR! 2015 participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. useR! 2015 participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference <em>without a refund</em> at the discretion of the useR! 2015 organisers.</p>

<h3>The Less Quick Version</h3>

<p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>

<p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>

<p>Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.</p>

<p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the useR! 2015 organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.</p>

<p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of useR! 2015 staff immediately. useR! 2015 staff can be identified as they will be wearing light green useR! 2015 t-shirts.</p>

<p>useR! 2015 staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of useR! 2015. We value your attendance.</p>

<p>We expect participants to follow these rules at conference and tutorial venue and conference-related social events (e.g. welcome reception and conference dinner).</p>
