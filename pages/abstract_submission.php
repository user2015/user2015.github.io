No further contributions will be considered. We thank
the R community for the overwhelming number of submitted
abstracts. We will announce the accepted contributions
when the reviewing process is completed.</p>

<p>
At useR! 2015 four types of sessions will be organised:
<ul>
<li><b>useR! Kaleidoscope:</b>
These sessions will give a broad overview of the many different applications of R and should appeal to a wide audience.</li>
<li><b>useR! Focus Sessions:</b>
These sessions will focus on topics of special interest and may be more technical.</li>
<li><b>useR! Lightning Talks:</b>
These sessions, with oral presentations of 5 minutes, provide a platform for participants to speak on any R-related topic and should particularly appeal to R newbies.</li>
<li><b>useR! Poster Session:</b> Shorter and less novel presentations of the usage of R to be enjoyed with drinks and light snacks.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<i><b>Technical details:</b></i><br>
<p>Note that <b>Kaleidoscope</b> and <b>Focus</b>
contributed talks, will be scheduled for 15 minutes,
followed by 2-3 minutes discussion. Presenters
of <b>Lightning talks</b> have 5 minutes at their
disposal to present 15 slides (exactly 20 seconds per
slide). A variation of the pecha kucha and ignite
formats will be used.</p>
