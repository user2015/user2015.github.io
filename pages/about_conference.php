<h1>About the Conference</h1>
	      <p>
		The
		annual <a href="http://www.r-project.org/conferences.html">useR!</a>
		international R User conference is the main meeting of
		the <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a> user and
		developer community. Its program consists of both
		invited and user-contributed presentations:
	      </p>
	      <ul>
		<li>The invited keynote lectures cover a broad
		  spectrum of topics ranging from technical and
		  R-related computing issues to general statistical
		  topics of current interest.</li>
		<li>The user-contributed presentations are submitted
		  as abstracts prior to the conference and may be
		  related to (virtually) any R-related topic. The
		  presentations are typically organised in sessions of
		  either broad or special interest, which also
		  comprise a "free" discussion format. Such a
		  discussion format not only provides a forum for
		  software demonstrations and detailed discussions but
		  also supports the self-organisation of the
		  respective communities.</li>
	      </ul>
