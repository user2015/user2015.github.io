<h3 id="alteryx">Alteryx: Who We Are, What We Do, What We Do for R</h3>
<p><i><b>Dan Putler</b> (max. 10 minutes)</i> [<a href="./presentations/sponsor-alteryx.pdf">slides</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
Organizations have an increasing amount of data that can be converted into information that offers the ability to make better decisions, find new opportunities, and improve efficiency. R is a critical advanced analytics tool that many organizations use to turn data into usable information. While the R language is comparatively easy to learn, it is still a traditional, written, computer programming language. Unfortunately, this fact alone limits the potential diffusion of R across most organizations, reducing its potential benefit to an organization. Alteryx is a platform for data blending and advanced analytics. Its objective is to empower a greater number of individuals across an organization to successfully accomplish these tasks, improving the overall performance of an organization. Alteryx uses R as a key element in powering much of its advanced analytics capabilities, in a much easier to approach interface. Alteryx itself is best viewed as both a data pipelining engine and a visual programming framework. In this talk, we introduce ourselves, highlight the benefits we provide our customers, particularly as it relates to R, and cover some of the things we do to help support the R community.

<h3 id="TIBCO">TIBCO Spotfire: Extending the Reach of the R Language to the Enterprise</h3>
<p><i><b>Lou Bajuk-Yorgan</b> (max. 10 minutes)</i> [<a href="./presentations/sponsor-tibco.pdf">slides</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
R provides tremendous value to statisticians and data scientists; however, these users of R are often challenged to extend that value to the rest of their organization. TIBCO, through it's enterprise-class, alternative R interpreter, TIBCO Enterprise Runtime for R (TERR), helps R users share their analytics more widely. TERR draws upon our long history of developing S+, and is integrated into BI applications (through Spotfire), real-time environments (through TIBCO Streambase), and into 3rd party products (such as Lavastorm Analytics), helping R users serve a much wider audience within their organizations. TERR provides an embeddable, high-performance platform for R language analyses.
